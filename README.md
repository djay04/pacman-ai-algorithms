   This project implements various search algorithms for the Berkeley Pacman AI project. The implementation includes:

   - Depth-First Search (DFS)
   - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
   - Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
   - A* Search

   ## Project Structure

   - `search.py`: Contains the implementation of search algorithms

   ## Credits
